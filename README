This is a copy of the libxdiff library 0.23 from here: http://www.xmailserver.org/xdiff-lib.html

Goal for this github project:
 Implement commandline interface for xdl_merge3() function.

Modifications:
 * Removed all autoconf HAVE_ macros
 * Removed STDC_HEADERS and VERSION macros
 * Removed several unused statements from config.h
 * Copied remaining config.h content into xinclude.h (mostly PACKAGE macros)
 * Removed obsolete xmissing.c and xmissing.h
 * Forcefully included stdio.h, stdlib.h, unistd.h, string.h and limits.h
 * New (and simple) Makefile
  
Extensions:
 * xdiff_merge3 example
